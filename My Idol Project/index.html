                <h2>About Linkin Park</h2>
                <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. 
                    The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, 
                    DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. 
                    The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon 
                    until Bennington's death by suicide in July 2017, which caused the band to enter an indefinite hiatus. 
                    In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.</p>
                <p>Categorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop,
                     while their later music features more electronica and pop elements. 
                     Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), 
                     which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 
                     Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to 
                     the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling", and "In the End" all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. 
                     The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation's Billboard Hot 100. 
                     Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. 
                     The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). 
                     By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.</p>
                <p>The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), 
                    layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), 
                    combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), 
                    returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, One More Light (2017), 
                    was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's upcoming eighth album, From Zero, 
                    is set to be released in November 2024.</p>
